# Residual-Networks
We will learn how to build very deep convolutional networks, using Residual Networks (ResNets). In theory, very deep networks can represent very complex functions; but in practice, they are hard to train. Residual Networks, introduced by He et al., allow us to train much deeper networks than were previously practically feasible.

In this project, we will:

1.) Implement the basic building blocks of ResNets.

2.)Put together these building blocks to implement and train a state-of-the-art neural network for image classification.

This project will be done in Keras.
